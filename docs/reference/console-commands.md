# Console commands

Every command of the bundle is prefixed `beffroi:`, and each one acts on the tenant the configuration
names. A command that reads is never the command that writes: `beffroi:user:show` reads,
`beffroi:user:profile` writes, and they are two classes.

Run `bin/console beffroi:<group>:<command> --help` for the arguments and the options of one of them; the
table below is the map.

## The tenant

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `beffroi:tenant:synchronize` | Write the row of the tenant of the configuration: created, renamed, or left alone. |

## Users, their credentials and what they agreed to

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `beffroi:user:applications` | List the applications a user agreed to, with what each one holds of them and what it has asked that is still waiting. |
| `beffroi:user:create` | Create a user of the tenant; give them a password with beffroi:user:set-password. |
| `beffroi:user:link` | Say that a user of the tenant is a given subject at an upstream provider; run again to refresh it. |
| `beffroi:user:profile` | Describe a user with the standard claims of OIDC Core section 5.1; what is not said is cleared, a run that says nothing writes nothing. To read a user, see beffroi:user:show. |
| `beffroi:user:revoke-consent` | Take back the consent a user gave a client, and the access it holds; the next authorization request asks again. |
| `beffroi:user:revoke-credential` | Revoke a credential of a user by its identifier; the credential stays listed as revoked. |
| `beffroi:user:revoke-session` | End a session of a user by its identifier; the relying parties of that session are told by the back-channel. |
| `beffroi:user:sessions` | List the sessions open in the name of a user, with what each one proved and where it was last seen. |
| `beffroi:user:set-password` | Set or replace the password of a user, asked on the terminal or read from the standard input. |
| `beffroi:user:show` | Show a user: the identity, the standard claims that are set, and the credentials with their kind, identifier, name and dates. |

## Clients and initial access tokens

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `beffroi:client:delete` | Delete a client that registered itself; a client declared in the configuration is refused. |
| `beffroi:client:list` | List the clients of the tenant: where each came from, when it was registered and when it was last used. |
| `beffroi:client:show` | Show a client of the tenant: where it came from, its dates, and what it registered. |
| `beffroi:client:token:issue` | Issue an initial access token for the tenant; the value is printed once and never again. |
| `beffroi:client:token:list` | List the initial access tokens of the tenant: what each has served, what it has left and whether it still authorises anything. |
| `beffroi:client:token:revoke` | Revoke an initial access token by its identifier; it authorises no registration from that instant. |

## Signing keys

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `beffroi:keys:activate` | Make a staged key the active one of its algorithm before its staging delay elapsed; the key it takes over from starts retiring. |
| `beffroi:keys:generate` | Generate a key, seal it with the configured KMS and make it the active one of its algorithm at once; "beffroi:keys:rotate" is the rotation without an outage. |
| `beffroi:keys:list` | List the keys of the tenant with their use, status and dates: the published ones, or every key with --all; --check opens the keys in use, or about to be, with the KMS and fails on one it cannot open. |
| `beffroi:keys:retire` | Take a retiring key out of the JWK Set: one key by its identifier, before its retirement date with --force; or every key past its date with --due. |
| `beffroi:keys:rotate` | Stage a new key, sealed by the configured KMS and published at once; it takes over once the staging delay elapsed, or at once with --now; --compromised retires the previous key with no window. |

## Data keys

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `beffroi:data-keys:destroy` | Erase the data keys of the tenant, which makes every personal datum it had sealed unreadable for good. Asks for the slug to be typed back. Cannot be undone. |
| `beffroi:data-keys:list` | List the data keys of the tenant by scope, with when each was minted, the master key that wraps it and the KMS client that opens it; reads only, and never opens a key. |
| `beffroi:data-keys:rewrap` | Wrap the data keys of the tenant with another KMS client from now on, or with another master key of the same one; --dry-run lists what would move. No sealed value is read or rewritten. |

## Passkeys and FIDO metadata

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `beffroi:webauthn:mds-import` | Store a metadata statement file (unsigned, trusted as the file is) next to the FIDO Metadata BLOB, for the keys of a manufacturer the service does not list or the authenticators of the FIDO conformance tools. |
| `beffroi:webauthn:mds-refresh` | Download the FIDO Metadata BLOB, verify its signature under the pinned root and store it for the passkey ceremonies; --url for another service, --root for another root. |

## What a command may not do

A command never bypasses a rule the protocol applies. It cannot mint a token for a user, cannot read a
signing key it is not allowed to open, and cannot read a personal datum the key management service refuses
to unseal. `beffroi:data-keys:destroy` is the one that cannot be undone, and it asks for the slug of the
tenant to be typed back before it runs.
