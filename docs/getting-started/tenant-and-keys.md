# The tenant and its keys

A provider that cannot sign cannot answer. Two things happen before the first request: the tenant of the
configuration gets its row, and it gets a key.

## The schema

The bundle ships its Doctrine migrations. Run them as you run any other:

``` bash
bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

## The tenant

The tenant is declared in the configuration, not created by a command: the issuer is a property of the
deployment. The command writes the row that matches what the configuration says.

``` bash
bin/console beffroi:tenant:synchronize
```

It says what it did: created, renamed, or left alone. Run it again after changing the issuer, on every
deployment, and it stays a no-op when nothing moved.

## A signing key

``` bash
bin/console beffroi:keys:generate
bin/console beffroi:keys:list
```

`beffroi:keys:generate` draws a key, seals it with the configured key management service and makes it the
active key of its algorithm at once. That is the right command for an empty deployment and the wrong one
for a live deployment, where [`beffroi:keys:rotate`](../reference/console-commands.md) replaces a key
without an outage: it stages the new key, publishes it in the JWK Set immediately, and lets it take over
once the staging delay has elapsed, so a client that cached the key set still verifies what it receives.

Check that the keys in use can actually be opened:

``` bash
bin/console beffroi:keys:list --check
```

That opens the keys in use, and the ones about to be, with the key management service, and fails on one it
cannot open. It is worth running in a deployment pipeline: a key the provider cannot open is an outage at
the first token request, not at the next rotation.

## A user

``` bash
bin/console beffroi:user:create alice --email alice@example.com
bin/console beffroi:user:set-password alice
```

The subject the clients will know Alice by is generated and stable. You pass `--subject` only when you are
importing an identity that already has one somewhere else.
