# The standalone application

`beffroi/op` is a provider you deploy rather than a provider you assemble: a Symfony skeleton on
[the bundle](../symfony-bundle/index.md), served by FrankenPHP in worker mode, with PostgreSQL for the
model and a broker for the writes the protocol does not wait on.

It is the deployment the project supports, and the one the conformance plans are run against, so a profile
reported green is green on this application.

## Why there is one at all

The bundle alone leaves a dozen decisions to whoever installs it: the web server, the worker, the broker,
the key management client, the migrations, the two planes, the images. Those decisions are the same for
almost everybody, so the project makes them once, in an application, instead of writing them again in a
guide. A team that wants to make them differently still can: the bundle is the same bundle.

|---|---|
| [Deployment](deployment.md) | The image, FrankenPHP in worker mode, and the two planes |
| [Configuration](configuration.md) | The environment the application reads, and what each variable decides |
| [Operating it](operating.md) | Rotating keys, rewrapping data keys, migrations, backups |
| [Observability](observability.md) | What the provider records of a request, a session and a token |

The repository is [beffroi-php/op](https://github.com/beffroi-php/op). It lives inside a working copy of the
monorepo during development, and is published on its own.
