description: What beffroi/symfony-bundle adds to an application: configuration, routes, persistence, security, pages and commands.

# The Symfony bundle

`beffroi/symfony-bundle` is the only place in Beffroi where Symfony appears. A `Request`, the container, the
entity manager, a Twig template and a console command live here and nowhere else, which is what keeps the
two packages underneath usable without a framework.

## What it brings

| Page | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [Configuration](configuration.md) | One tree under `beffroi`, section by section, validated when the container is built |
| [Routes and planes](routes-and-planes.md) | The controllers of both planes, and `BEFFROI_PLANE` to restrict a process to one |
| [Persistence](persistence.md) | The Doctrine mapping, the migrations, and the DBAL types that read value objects back |
| [Security](security.md) | The firewalls, the authenticators, and what a session carries |
| [Key management](key-management.md) | The key management client the private keys are sealed with |
| [Pages](pages.md) | Login, consent, logout, device, and how to make them yours |
| [Translations](translations.md) | Every user-facing string, in XLIFF, with the locale read from `ui_locales` |
| [Messenger](messenger.md) | Which writes are asynchronous, and which ones the protocol waits for |
| [The account pages](account.md) | What a person sees of themselves, and what they can take back |
| [Console commands](console-commands.md) | Tenant, users, clients, keys, data keys, FIDO metadata |
| [The profiler panel](profiler.md) | What the provider did during a request, in the Symfony profiler |

## Installing it

``` bash
composer require beffroi/symfony-bundle
```

## Conventions it follows

Knowing these makes the rest of this section predictable.

- **A controller is `final readonly`, one action per class**, with the route on `__invoke()`. There is no
  controller with six methods.
- **A route name carries its plane**: `beffroi_protocol_*` is server to server, `beffroi_interaction_*` is a
  browser. Nothing is ambiguous, and a process can be restricted to one of the two.
- **A value object a column holds whole goes in one column**, with a DBAL type of the bundle that reads it
  back through the object's own constructor. There is no Doctrine embeddable fixing one type per field for
  the whole model.
- **No write is synchronous unless the protocol needs its result in the same request.** Every exception is
  listed in the Messenger configuration with the reason it is one.
- **Every user-facing string is translated**, and the locale of an interaction comes from `ui_locales`, then
  `Accept-Language`, never from the URL.
- **A test never sleeps.** Time moves with a mocked clock, which survives a kernel reboot.
